Sevora's Story. UNLICENSED. All rights reserved.

## Overview
This is the story website of Sevora ([@ralphlouisgopez](https://twitter.com/ralphlouisgopez)) made from pure code. The source code is written in ES6 thus a webpack transpiler was set up in order to maximize compatibility. I used the same template I made for my portfolio which is single web page applications. However, the content in here is different. This is about my own personal story and it won't give off a professional vibe but rather something more homey. I made it a watch theme as I like the concept of being able to show the past and the present designed neatly.

## Installation
- `npm install --dev` - to install all the dependencies for the transpiler setup. 
- `npm run build` - to transpile the source code inside the js directory and save results to assets bundle folder.
